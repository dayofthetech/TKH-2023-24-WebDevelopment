[X] make sure API works
[] add click event listener to a btn to fetch img
    []so the img will be inside btn and btn background will be green
[] once fetch i will display two img, each img will have its own btn func to handle click
[] user will try to match same img
[] if user guess incorrect img will flip back
[] countdown
